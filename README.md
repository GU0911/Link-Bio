## Project Description üìù

Link-Bio provides a streamlined and efficient backend service for creating and managing personalized link-in-bio pages. In today's digital landscape, a concise and customizable "link in bio" is crucial for directing social media followers and target audiences to relevant content, products, or services.

This service is designed for individuals, influencers, businesses, and anyone seeking a centralized hub to share multiple links through a single, shareable URL. It overcomes the limitation of most social media platforms that only allow one link in the profile description.

Built with Go, Link-Bio offers a performant and scalable solution, suitable for handling a large number of users and links. The use of Docker and Docker Compose simplifies deployment and ensures consistent behavior across environments.

The architecture focuses on maintainability and extensibility, making it easy to add new features and adapt to evolving requirements. By providing a clean API and well-defined data models, Link-Bio empowers users to manage their online presence effectively.

## Installation & Running Locally üöÄ

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.20 or higher)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Gaeuly/Link-Bio.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Link-Bio
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file. Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration. At a minimum, you'll need to set database connection details.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit the .env file with your preferred editor, e.g., nano, vim, or VS Code.
    nano .env
    ```
    Make sure to set the correct database parameters in the .env file.

4. **Build and Run the Docker containers:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    This command will build the Docker image (if it doesn't exist) and start the application containers.  The `--build` flag ensures that the image is rebuilt if the `Dockerfile` has been modified.

5.  **Access the API:**

    ```bash
    http://localhost:8080
    ```
    
    The API should now be accessible at `http://localhost`.  You'll need to consult any relevant API documentation to determine the specific endpoints.

6.  **Run the Application Directly (Without Docker):**

    Alternatively, you can run the application directly using Go:
    
    ```bash
    go mod download
    go run main.go
    ```
